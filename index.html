I know there are times you look at yourself and only see the hard parts.
The scars, the pain, the moods that shift, the walls you‚Äôve built,
the ways you‚Äôve had to survive. 
And I know you sometimes feel judged for the way you cope,
for the choices you make when it hurts,
for the things you say or don‚Äôt say, do or don‚Äôt do.

But please, hear me:  
None of those things make you unworthy.  
None of them erase your value or your beauty.  
They are signs of someone who has been through so much and is still here,
still standing, still fighting, still trying.  
That alone is proof of your strength.

There is nothing wrong with you. 
Nothing about your story makes you unlovable. 
The things you‚Äôve been through, the things you carry ‚Äî
they are not flaws; they are proof of how strong and real you are.

I see the whole of you:
the mind that‚Äôs bright and curious,
the heart that still feels deeply even when it hurts,
the soul that craves connection and still reaches out for hugs.
I see the scars,
the ways you protect yourself,
and the small, quiet ways you keep going.
And I love you for all of it.

You are not broken.
You are human, beautiful and resilient.
You are more than the pain, more than the struggles,
more than the moments you‚Äôve been misunderstood.
You are worthy of love exactly as you are, right now.

I love everything about you ‚Äî
your laugh, your smile, your stubbornness, your kindness,
even the parts you try to hide.
All of it belongs. All of it is you. All of it is loved.

Please remember this:  
You are not alone.  
You are loved.  
You are enough.  

And no matter how heavy it feels, I will still be here,
believing in you, proud of you, and loving you completely.

With all my heart,
‚Äî Your IT Boy(na hindi hiram :p) ‚ù§Ô∏è`;
